 - In early 1990's ``Time Berner lee`` introduced ``WEB`` and a language for "WEB" that is ``HTML``[Open Source].
 - IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) these people developed HTML for several years up to HTML3.1.
 - In 2004 ``WHATWG``(Web Hypertext Application Technology Work Group) took the responsibility of HTML and started the 
    version ``HTML4.0``.

## Browser Architecture üåêüíªüõ†Ô∏è

A ``browser`` is a software tool that allows users to access webpages on a client device. Popular browsers include:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

Each browser consists of the following components:
### 1. User Interface (UI)
This includes elements such as the title bar, address bar, refresh button, etc., that allow users to interact with the browser.

### 2. Browser Engine
The browser engine is responsible for converting HTML and CSS into a format that the browser can understand. Different browsers use different browser engines, such as:

- **Gecko** (used by Firefox)
- **WebKit** (used by Safari)
- **Blink** (used by Chrome and Edge)
- **Chakra** (used by older versions of Edge)
- **SpiderMonkey** (JavaScript engine for Firefox)

### 3. Rendering Engine
This component is responsible for the presentation of processed content. It interprets the content from HTML and CSS into a visual display on the screen.

### 4. JavaScript Interpreter
Browsers use JavaScript for interactive functionality. The JavaScript interpreter converts JavaScript code into a format the browser can execute.

### 5. Networking
The networking component manages all network activities in the browser, including:

- Loading resources such as images, scripts, and stylesheets
- Handling the number of requests made per page
- Measuring the time taken to load content

### 6. UI Backend
This component contains the logic responsible for rendering the user interface, including buttons, checkboxes, and other input controls.

### 7. Data Persistence
Browsers store user data in different formats to enhance user experience, including:

- **Local Storage**: Stores data across sessions
- **Session Storage**: Stores data for the duration of a session
- **Cookies**: Store small amounts of data for stateful interactions with websites

## HTML Parsing in Browser

### Flow 
Markup 
   -> bytes 
      -> characters 
         -> Tokens [Tags] 
            -> Elements [Nodes] 
               -> DOM 
                  -> Layout 
                     -> Rendering 
                        -> Painting

*HTML       - presenting DOM* <br>
*JAVASCITPT - Modifying  DOM*

- HTML present content on browser using elements arranged in hierarchial order called "DOM".
- There are 100's of elements.

### HTML Elements are classified into 5 categories

### a. Normal Elements
- Elements which return a presentation directly on callback [without any additional attributes].
- Elements in HTML are built using tags.
- Normal elements require a start tag and end tag.
- Normal elements will start returning presentation but can‚Äôt stop implicitly.
- They require an explicit end tag.
- Usually require start and end tags.
	
- Example:
```HTML
<b>HELLO</b>
```
### b. Void Elements
- Void elements refer to elements that don‚Äôt return any presentation directly upon being rendered.
- The term "void" indicates that they have no return type.
- They can return specific content and stop implicitly.
- Void elements do not require an "end tag."

Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
```
### c. Raw Text Elements
- These elements are presented without a tag.<br>
		eg:: Temparature20C 45000/-<br>
		     Temparture&deg;C &#8377;45000/-
		     
Example:
```html
&copy; ¬©
&#8377;
&deg;
```

### d. RC Data Elements
- RC Data Elements, or Rich Text Content Elements, do not allow any other elements within their context.

Example:
```html
<textarea>
    Hello
    <b>pwian's</b>
</textarea 
```

### e. Foreign Elements
- Foreign elements are those that are not natively understood by every browser.
- You need to import a library that enables browser compatibility with these elements.

Example:
- SVG
- MathML
- Canvas


## HTML Page Structure

- Every HTML file must have static extensions called ".html or .htm"
- Every HTML page starts with documentation declaration from HTML5 version.<br>
 			<!doctype html><br>
	It is a indication to the browser engine that i am using latest features of HTML, if we don't specify the doctype then the
	browser engine understands the HTML has "HTML4" version.

- Every HTML page must have a documentation scope, It specifies the start and end of the document in browser.
#### eg: 
      <html> 
		document scope
		</html>

    eg#1.
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
        	document-1
	</html>
	<html>
        	document-2
	</html>
	     Note: If some changes needs to be done in document-1, then it creates a problem because browser does the below things
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
        	document-1 document-2
	</html>
   

#### Every document scope must have "lang" attribute.It is used to define language for the web page content.
	<html lang="en-IN">
	<html lang="en-US">
		eg:: amazon.com (USA) , amazon.in(IND)

#### Every document scope has 2 sections at high level.
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
        	<head>

        	</head>
        	<body>
                
        	</body>
	</html>
	
### HeadSection 
- It Comprises of the Content loaded into browser memory and later delivered to browser UI, so that we can reuse the content across multiple requests.
- It typically contains the following components
			a.link	 b.meta  c.style  d.scripts e.title

### title
-  It is used for browser and SEO.[Search Engine Optmisation]<br>
   Note: ROBOTS [Google BOT, WebCrawlers, WebSpiders]<br>
- Broswer uses title tag to display in "titlebar" and in "favourites".[While bookmarking the webpage]
- SEO uses title to display in search results.

### link  
- It is used to link any external document like css file or shortcut icon.
#### Note: favicon.ico -> size (16px to 32px), type(.ico)

					index.html
		<html lang="en-US">

       - **3 Chars Code:**
         - `#RGB`
       - **6 Chars Code:**
         - `#RRGGBB`

It sets a background image to the body section.

**Syntax:**
```html

  These attributes are defined in ``style`` manner.

CSS attributes for background are:

```html
<style>
     body {
         background-repeat: no-repeat;

## Semantics in Body Section  
- An element used for a specific purpose.  
- HTML has more than 100 of semantics according to MDN.  
- WHATWG(HTML), W3C(WEB), Javascript(ECMA) for these 3 people documentation is prepared by MDN (Mozilla Development Network).  
- HTML5 introduced semantics for body section to make it more SEO [Search Engine Optimization] friendly.  
- Old websites are not SEO friendly, but by using HTML5 we make webpages SEO friendly.

## Body section semantics for Layout Design  
- HTML4 uses table element for designing a "Layout".  
- Table is not SEO Friendly  
- Table leads to a situation known as "Kiss-Of-Death". [refer image for this problem]  
- HTML5 introduced new "Semantics" for designing a Layout.  
- The new semantics will make a page SEO Friendly.  
- The new layout semantics are  
    `<aside>` `<article>`  `<header>`  `<footer>` `<div>` `<span>` `<figure>` `<figcaption>`  `<dialog>`  `<main>`  `<section>`  `<div>`  `<span>`  

 **div and span tag**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>layout</title>
    <style>
        div {
            border: 2px solid black;
            margin: 5px;
            padding: 5px;
        }
        span {
            background-color: rgb(0, 174, 255);
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        Web Development
        <div>
            FrontEnd
            <div>
                HTML
                It is a <span>markup</span> language
            </div>
            <div>
                CSS
                It is a styling language
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            BackEnd
            <div>
                MongoDB
                It is a database
            </div>
            <div>
               Node.js
               It is a server-side scripting language
            </div>
        </div>
    </div> 
</body>
</html>
```

[!NOTE] The `<span>` tag is much like the `<div>` element,  
      but `<div>` is a block-level element and `<span>` is an inline element.
