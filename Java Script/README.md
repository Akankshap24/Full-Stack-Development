# What is JavaScript ?

JavaScript is a `lightweight`, `interpreted`, and `just-in-time (JIT) compiled` programming language.



## ✅ Key Concepts

| Concept         | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lightweight**| Uses less memory and resources. Easy to embed and quick to load         |
| **Interpreted**| Code is executed **line by line** at runtime                            |
| **Compiled**   | Code is translated to machine code before or during execution           |



## ⚙️ Types of Compilation in JavaScript

| Type      | Full Form           | When It Happens                         | How It Works                                                             | Example                    |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **JIT**   | Just-in-Time        | **During runtime** (after user request) | Code is compiled **in the browser**, just before it's executed            | Chrome's **V8 Engine**     |
| **AOT**   | Ahead-of-Time       | **Before runtime** (during build)       | Code is compiled **before deployment**, at the **application level**     | **Angular** with AOT build |


## 📝 Example Use

- Browsers like Chrome, Firefox → `JIT Compilation`
- Frameworks like Angular → `AOT Compilation` for faster initial load.

## ⚙️ JavaScript Engines & Compilers

JavaScript can run using different `engines` and `compilers` across environments:

| Tool     | Description                                           |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ivy**  | Angular's next-gen compilation and rendering engine   |
| **Babel**| JavaScript compiler that converts ES6+ to ES5         |
| **Node** | Runtime for executing JS on the server (built on V8) |
| **V8**   | Google Chrome's powerful JavaScript engine            |

## 🧠 JavaScript Programming Paradigms

JavaScript supports `multiple programming paradigms`:

| Paradigm               | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structural**         | Code is organized using functions and blocks                      |
| **Functional**         | Emphasizes pure functions, immutability, and function composition |
| **Imperative**         | Code describes **how** things should happen (step-by-step)        |
| **Object-Oriented**    | Uses objects and inheritance (but **not fully OOP**)              |

> 🔎 **Note:** JavaScript is *not a purely OOP language*, but it supports some OOP concepts like objects, classes, and inheritance (via prototypes).

## 🧩 JavaScript Usage in Full-Stack Projects

JavaScript is used at **various layers** of development:

| Layer          | Tool / Tech                                | Role                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Client Side**| HTML + JavaScript                          | Dynamic frontend interaction         |
| **Server Side**| Node.js                                     | Backend logic and APIs               |
| **Database**   | MongoDB (with JS-based queries)             | Data storage using JS-like syntax    |
| **Animation**  | Tools like Flash, 3DS Max (older usage)     | Motion graphics, UI effects          |
